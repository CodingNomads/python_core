Build on Exercise 02 from objects_classes_methods. Create subclasses of
two of the existing classes. Create a subclass of on of those so that the
hierarchy is at least three levels.

Build these classes out like we did in Exercise 02.

If you cannot think of way to build on your Exercise 02 classes you can
start from scratch here.

We encourage you to be creative and try to think of an example of your own for this
exercise but if you are stuck, some ideas include:

    - A Vehicle superclass, with Truck and Motorcycle subclasses.
    - A Restaurant superclass, with Gourmet and FastFood subclasses.
