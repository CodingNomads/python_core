# python_core

CodingNomads repo for Python fundamentals. Final version should include:

- labs
- challenges
- questions
- project work

## more mini-projects/labs
- tuples

## labs_todo

### TODOs on lab sections

#### TODO (for all): add answers to text questions; connect textbook example answers
#### Go over all and fix the exercise and page numbering!

#### Section-specific notes

- 01_intro
    - think about adding more questions and labs

- 04_variable_statements
    - Ex01 - Ex03 only require copy-paste?
    - TODO (move): 08 + 09 are about user input()

- 05_string
    - not sure we need exercise_06
    - yeah I found it a bit confusing, maybe can be further improved

- 06_lists
    - 03(ex.10-1) introduces an easy map()
    - 03(ex.10-1) tried implementing it with recursion (IMPROVE!)
    - 03-06 contain only references to the exercises in the book
        - solutions can be added separately

- 07_tuples
    - more tuple labs/projects

- 09_conditionals_loops
    - add recursion questions
    - add recursion labs

- 10_classes_objects_methods
    - include type-based dispatch?
    - build out exercise 3

- 11_functions
    - need more exercises?

- 12_inheritance
    - solutions
    - in 01 fix the reference to the "Exercise 02 from objects_classes_methods"
        because it'll probably be called differently

- 13_files
    - maybe add db I/O and pickling
