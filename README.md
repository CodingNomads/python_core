### Questions for Caden

- how did you choose the exercises from the book?
- shouldn't the students do all exercises from the book?
- if some, should they be written out in here or just refer to the book?
- can you write objectives for the choice of the lab?
    * makes it easier to sort them
    * also great for students to understand why they are learning smth
