Complete exercises 8.5 and 8.6

CODE:

word = 'banana'
count = 0
for letter in word:
    if letter == 'a':
        count = count + 1
print count

8.5 - Encapsulate this code in a function named count,
and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the letter as arguments.

8.6 - Rewrite this function so that instead of traversing the string,
it uses the three-parameter version of find from the previous section.
